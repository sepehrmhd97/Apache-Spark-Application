# Apache-Spark-Application
#Abstract
This assignment focuses on Apache Spark, a powerful distributed computing framework that enables
large-scale data processing with high performance. The assignment covers various aspects of
Spark, including Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs), data partitioning, DataFrame, and Spark
SQL. Additionally, it discusses best practices for improving Spark performance, such as optimizing
code, increasing the number of worker nodes, and allocating memory.
In addition, the assignment includes practical applications of Spark using PySpark, enabling
students to write code and perform distributed computing.
